# Learn-Conditional-GAN-with-Examples

In this project there is a conditional GAN Network which will create Fashional MNIST Data based on the number:

**Steps to run the the project**

**Step1** : To train the model run "train.py" . It is already run for 500 Epochs. SO anyone can use it directly.

**Step2** : To test the model run "inference.py" . It will ask to input one integer between 0 to 9. 

**NOTE :** You can use the tensorboard to see the development of them model.
